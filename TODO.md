# TODO
- [ ] Add logging functionality. This would mainly be so that there would be better
  debugging abilities.
- [ ] Create new branch, and in that branch do the following:
  - [ ] Move the "print_invalid_args" function to the "parsing.py" module.
- [ ] Make the output when filtering endpoints in such way, that the "Endpoint
  [endpoint_number]" field would be left as only with the index of the endpoint.
- [ ] Implement functionality that would apply to flags "-s" and "--sort", that
  would enable user to tweak the way the sorting would be done (alphabetical
  -sort, sort by length etc).
