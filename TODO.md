# TODO
- Add logging functionality. This would mainly be so that there would be better
  debugging abilities â€“ as right now there is not!
- Implement a functionality, that would make it possible to fetch the 'disallowed'
  endpoint fields only.
- Implement "-h" and "--help" flags.
- In module "endpoints.py":
  - Create functions "count_allowed" and "count_disallowed".
- In module "headers.py":
  - Create a function "print_".
